ðŸš€ CodeAlpha Internship Projects

This repository contains the Python projects I completed during my CodeAlpha Internship. Each task focuses on implementing core programming concepts in Python with simple, beginner-friendly approaches.

âœ… TASK 1: Hangman Game

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Create a simple text-based Hangman game where the player guesses a word one letter at a time.

ðŸ”¹ Scope:

Uses a small list of 5 predefined words.

Allows only 6 incorrect guesses.

Console-based (no graphics/audio).

ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts Used: random, while loop, if-else, strings, lists.

âœ… TASK 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Build a simple stock tracker that calculates total investment value.

ðŸ”¹ Scope:

User enters stock names and quantity.

Hardcoded dictionary stores stock prices (e.g., {"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 250}).

Displays total investment value.

Optionally saves the result in a .txt or .csv file.

ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts Used: dictionary, input/output, basic arithmetic, file handling.

âœ… TASK 3: Task Automation with Python Scripts

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Automate a small repetitive real-life task.

ðŸ”¹ Ideas Implemented:

Move all .jpg files from one folder to another.

Extract all email addresses from a .txt file and save to another file.

Scrape the title of a fixed webpage and save it.

ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts Used: os, shutil, re, requests, file handling.

âœ… TASK 4: Basic Chatbot

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Build a simple rule-based chatbot.

ðŸ”¹ Scope:

User inputs like "hello", "how are you", "bye".

Predefined replies: "Hi!", "I'm fine, thanks!", "Goodbye!".

Continuous chatting until user types "bye" or "exit".

ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts Used: if-elif, functions, loops, input/output.


ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

Practiced Python fundamentals like loops, conditionals, functions, lists, and dictionaries.

Gained experience with automation, file handling, and simple scraping.

Understood how to build interactive console-based applications.
